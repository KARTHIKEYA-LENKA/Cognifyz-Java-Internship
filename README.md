## ✅ Level 1 — Basic Java Programs
**1. Temperature Converter:** Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Skills: User input, arithmetic operations.  
Sample Output: `Enter temperature in Celsius: 37` → `Temperature in Fahrenheit: 98.6°F`

**2. Palindrome Checker:** Checks if a string is palindrome (ignores spaces/punctuation). Skills: String manipulation, loops, conditionals.  
Sample Output: `Enter a string: racecar` → `"racecar" is a palindrome.`

**3. Student Grade Calculator:** Accepts student marks, calculates average and grade. Skills: Arrays, loops, arithmetic.  
Sample Output: `Enter marks for 3 subjects: 85 90 78` → `Average: 84.33` → `Grade: A`

**4. Random Password Generator:** Generates random password with user-defined length & character types. Skills: Random, StringBuilder, conditions.  
Sample Output: `Enter password length: 10` → `Generated Password: Ab3#kP9@qL`

## ✅ Level 2 — Intermediate Java Programs
**1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game:** Two-player console-based game. Skills: Arrays, loops, win/draw checking.  
Sample Output: `Player X, enter your move (1-9): 5` → `Player O, enter your move (1-9): 1` → `Player X wins!`

**2. Password Strength Checker:** Checks password strength (length, upper/lowercase, digits, special chars). Skills: String handling, regex, conditions.  
Sample Output: `Enter password: P@ssw0rd123` → `Password Strength: Strong`

**3. File Encryption/Decryption:** Encrypts and decrypts text files with a simple algorithm. Skills: File handling, string manipulation, I/O.  
Sample Output: `Original Text: Hello World` → `Encrypted Text: Khoor Zruog` → `Decrypted Text: Hello World`

## ✅ Level 3 — Advanced Java Programs
**1. Chat Application (Sockets):** Client-server chat using Java Sockets. Skills: Networking, multithreading.  
How to Run: `java ChatServer` → `java ChatClient`  
Sample Output (Client): `Connected to server. Enter message: Hello!` → `Server: Hi there!`

**2. Multi-threaded Application:** Demonstrates concurrency with multiple threads. Skills: Threads, synchronization.  
Sample Output: `Thread 1: Counting 1` → `Thread 2: Counting 1` → `Thread 1: Counting 2` → `Thread 2: Counting 2`

**3. Desktop Calculator (Swing):** GUI calculator using Swing components. Skills: Swing, event handling.  
Sample Output: *(Attach a screenshot in `images/Calculator.png` if desired)*

**4. Currency Converter (API Integration):** Converts currency using [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/) API. Skills: HTTP requests, JSON parsing.  
Sample Output: `Enter amount in USD: 100` → `Converted amount in INR: 8,250.50`
